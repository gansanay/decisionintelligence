### What's this?

This is the (hopefully up-to-date) archive of the most inspiring Decision Intelligence speaker, Cassie Kozyrkov.

As Wikipedia puts it, she founded the field of Decision Intelligence at Google, where she serves as Chief Decision Scientist.

She is on a mission to teach to a large audience how the availability of massive amounts of data and efficient ways to handle them leads us to rethink strategy and decision-making. Or, if I may, at last really think carefully about strategy and decision-making.

It then seemed useful to have at hand a comprehensive and annotated archive of all of Cassie's writings, podcasts and talks.

Some quotes:
Data science is the discipline of making data useful.
Statistics is the science of changing your mind.
Frequentists change their mind about actions. Bayesians change their mind about beliefs.

Some links to Cassie's online presence are in order:
* Her tweets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quaesita)
* Her articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kozyrkov)
* Her newsletter on [Substack](https://decision.substack.com)
