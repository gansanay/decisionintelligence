### What's this?

This is just a dump for raw ideas waiting to be structured as notes.

### Idea dump

* Your job is not to retrieve data but to provide meaning.

* If you're just bringing data to feed the biased opinions of your clients, you're not doing this job. You may think, they may think it is your job, but it's not *the* job.

* Reporting is a product.

* Reproducibility
If you can't at any given time in the future find the exact output you are providing today, you are taking a risk. 

* If you can't explicitly provide the assumptions, perimeter and method for every one of your Tableau dashboards, you would be better off going back to Excel because you don't bring value. You're just bringing more fog. 

* Automate everything
You won't be able to keep up if you don't build an automation system. This also means that you can't avoid being a programmer.

* Refactor until you have the most versatile weapons enabling you the shortest reaction time for every need.

* Build the platform that suits your needs. It doesn't need to be built from scratch. But it doesn't exist if you don't build it for your own specific set of data, constraints and objectives. 

* Your job doesn't end when you have a clean dataset which tells everything. 

* You're not finding one answer at a time. You're building an information domain in which you go when asked a question. Then you come back with the answer, or often with a better question and its answer.

* Your most important job is to build the one thing you are never going to deliver : your information domain / information structure. 

* Your information domain is made of 
1/ filtered, restructured data built using the best lessons you learned about how things can go wrong in how your client organization  sours information
2/ external data which provides context and comparisons to the internal data at hand
